NOTE.

After running the monkey similarity, I found out that Cats don't really have similarities with bananas, 
meaning they donâ€™t really eat bananas, while monkey has a very high percentage of similarity with banana,
which means they eat bananas a lot, also monkey and cat has the highest percentage cause both are mammals  
and animals.

NOTE. 
"en_core_web_md" 
Only returns the actual similarity percentage, while 

"en_core_web_sm"
returns Userwarning message followed by the similarity percentage 
but the percentage seem higher than that of "en_core_web_md" 
so it seem "en_core_web_sm" works better with list while "en_core_web_md" works more with stings
